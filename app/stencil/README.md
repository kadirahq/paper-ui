# Storybook for Stencil.js

---

Storybook for stencil is a UI development environment for your plain stencil snippets.
With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively.

Storybook runs outside of your app.
So you can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and requirements.

## Getting Started

With the current state you will be able to write your stories using stencil.

```
cd my-app
npm i @storybook/stencil

npm run build:watch
npm run storybook
```
